%1. Conjugate Gradient Method with Flecther-Reeves (or Polak-Ribiere)
%   to find a vector x that gives a MINIMUM of a function (a scalar).
%2. Ideas taken from J.R. Shewchuk and Numerical Recipes.
%3. You must modify your own function to minimise in a Matlab 
%   function file called func.m (scalar output) and the first derivative of that
%   function in a matlab function file called dfunc.m, which has a vector output in 
%   (del/del(x1) del/del(x2) ... etc)'. 
%4. If you want to MAXIMISE a function, multiply -1 to the output of func.m
%   and dfunc.m (be careful here, dfunc.m may use func.m; to be safe, give dfunc.m
%   the original output of func.m and then multiply -1 to dfunc.m at the end). 
%   If you are brave, reverse the search direction r and d for maximisation.
%5. If the method is not converging or is giving you a solution that doesn't make sense, 
%   change the initial guess.
%6. As an example, a simple function is given in func.m and its gradient vector in dfunc.m. 
%   Change the initial guess to x = [1 ; 1] for example, the solution it gives is incorrect. 
%   The reason is obvious if you plot the function (it is the saddle points). 
%7. I have used these scripts to optimise a fairly complicated function. They 
%   seem to work well. If you notice any bug or have any comment, please email me
%   king at ictp at it
